libDSON
===
Such MIT-licence. Much DSON parse. Very unfinished. Wow.

This is a very basic C++ library for parsing DSON (Doge Serialized Object Notation) files, making it easy to integrate DSON parsing with virtually any C++ program.

The files for the library can be included directly into a project with minimal effort. 
Alternatively, on *nixes, the provided Makefile will create a statically linked library.
