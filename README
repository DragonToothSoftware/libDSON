Such MIT-licence. Much DSON parse. Wow.

This is a very basic C++ library for parsing and serializing DSON (Doge Serialized Object Notation) files, making it easy to integrate DSON parsing with virtually any C++ program.

This library consists of two files and has no dependencies beyond the standard C++ library, meaning it can be included directly into a project with minimal effort.
 
The provided makefile can be used to create a statically linked library on *nixes.
